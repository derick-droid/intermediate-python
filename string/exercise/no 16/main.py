Companies often try to personalize their offers to make them more attractive. One simple
way to do this is just to insert the person’s name at various places in the offer. Of course,
companies don’t manually type in every person’s name; everything is computer-generated.
Write a program that asks the user for their name and then generates an offer like the one
below. For simplicity’s sake, you may assume that the person’s first and last names are one
word each.
