Write a program that asks the user to enter a string. The program should create a new string
called new_string from the userâ€™s string such that the second character is changed to an
asterisk and three exclamation points are attached to the end of the string. Finally, print
new_string. Typical output is shown below:
Enter your string: Qbert
Q*ert!!!
