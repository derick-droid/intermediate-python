"""
There are a number of common things that can be represented by two-dimensional lists, like a Tic-
tac-toe board or the pixels on a computer screen. In Python, one way to create a two-dimensional
list is to create a list whose items are themselves lists. Here is an example:

"""

def dimen():
    L = [[1, 2, 3],
         [4, 5, 6],
         [7, 8, 9]]

    print(L[1] [2])


dimen()
