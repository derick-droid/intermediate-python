Write a program that estimates the average number of drawings it takes before the user’s
numbers are picked in a lottery that consists of correctly picking six different numbers that
are between 1 and 10. To do this, run a loop 1000 times that randomly generates a set of
user numbers and simulates drawings until the user’s numbers are drawn. Find the average
number of drawings needed over the 1000 times the loop runs.
