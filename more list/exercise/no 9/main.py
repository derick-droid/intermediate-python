Write a simple quiz game that has a list of ten questions and a list of answers to those ques-
tions. The game should give the player four randomly selected questions to answer. It should
ask the questions one-by-one, and tell the player whether they got the question right or
wrong. At the end it should print out how many out of four they got right.
